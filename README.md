# PowerBI_Credit_Card_Report


Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing credit card transactions and customer details to gain actionable insights.
Using Power BI, I created interactive dashboards to visualize key metrics and trends related to credit card revenue, customer demographics, and transaction patterns.


Data Sources

The project uses two primary datasets:

1.	Credit Card Transaction Details: Includes information on transaction amounts, interest earned, expenditure types, and payment methods (swipe, chip, online).
   
2.	Credit Card Customer Details: Contains demographic data such as age, gender, income group, marital status, job type, and education level.

Tools Used

•	Power BI: For data visualization and dashboard creation.

•	Excel: For data preparation and cleanup.


Insights Derived

•	Customers in higher income groups contribute significantly to the revenue.

•	The "Blue" card category generates the highest revenue among card types.

•	Bills and entertainment are the top spending categories.

•	Married individuals generate more revenue compared to single or unknown marital statuses.

Future Improvements

•	Integrate real-time transaction data for up-to-date analytics.

•	Include predictive analysis to identify potential revenue growth areas.
